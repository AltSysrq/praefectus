This directory contains a simple demonstrational program, as well as front-ends
to visualise and analyse its output.

The main program is a distributed "N-bodies" simulation, where each node
controls one body. Each body naturally moves in a straight line, and only
undergoes velocity changes as a result of events. This is not meant to be a
useful way to distribute the N-bodies problem; rather, it is a model with a
well-understood behaviour which is also easy to visualise and reason about.

For the sake of simplicity, the configuration gits compiled into each variant
of the main program. Each process can control any number of logical nodes.

The output from a process is a CSV containing the following fields:

- Instant, decimal
- Self node id, unsigned hexadecimal
- Other node id, unsigned hexadecimal
- X coordinate of other node, unsigned hexadecimal
- Y coordinate of other node, unsigned hexadecimal
- X velocity of other node, signed decimal
- Y velocity of other node, signed decimal
- Latency to other node, unsigned decimal
