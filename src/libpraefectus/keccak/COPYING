Files in this directory are not covered by the same copyright as the rest of
this project, but according to the terms set forth at the head of each file.

Some trivial modifications were made to the two *.c files
(KeccakF-1600-opt64.c, KeccakSponge.c) by Jason Lingle in order to properly
integrate them into this project's build system, and to fix a name conflict
with a system header file. It is not believed that this constitutes any
copyrightable change; however, to avoid such ambiguity, all such copyright (or
other related rights) to these edits is hereby waived.
