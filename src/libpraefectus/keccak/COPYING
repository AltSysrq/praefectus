Files in this directory are not covered by the same copyright as the rest of
this project, but according to the terms set forth at the head of each file.

Some trivial modifications were made to the two *.c files
(KeccakF-1600-opt64.c, KeccakSponge.c) by Jason Lingle in order to properly
integrate them into this project's build system, to fix a name conflict with a
system header file, and to restore compliance with C89; additionally, a couple
unused variables were removed to silence compiler warnings. It is not believed
that this constitutes any copyrightable change (since no details of the
implementation or documentation have been altered); however, to avoid such
ambiguity, all such copyright (or other related rights) to these edits is
hereby waived.
