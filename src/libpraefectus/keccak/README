This directory constains the optimised reference implementation of the Keccak
(SHA-3) hash function. It was obtained from
https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage, commit
32b2147bfbe65238f0043f7282b87fbcdd874b04, on 2014-07-03.

The sources are compiled directly into libpraefectus. The header
keccak-rename.h is used to rename the exported symbols to have the praef_
prefix, so as to avoid collisions with any other software that does something
similar.
