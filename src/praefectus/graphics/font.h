 *
 * In order to match the low-resolution style of the rest of the game,
 * praefectus uses hand-defined raster fonts. These fonts only support the
 * ASCII character set, but there is support for overstriking characters
 * sufficient to support the silly Polish names of most of the in-game
 * objects.
 *
 * Every character is defined by a rectangular grid of characters from the set
 * ' ', '-', '=', '#', and '.'. ' ' is always transparent. '#', '=', and '-'
 * correspond to palette colours 0, 1, and 2, respetively. Generally colour 1
 * is full intensity, 1 is half intensity, and 2 is quarter intensity. '.'
 * corresponds to palette colour 3, but is transparent unless the font is drawn
 * with borders enabled. Palettes are specified as indices into the the canvas
 * palette when a string is rendered.
 *
 * Characters are measured as per the diagramme below. Note that kerning is
 * automatically derived from lead/tail pairs of adjacent characters.
 *
 *             /-- Lead mid, bottom
 *             |/-- Lead top
 *             || /-- Tail top
 *             || |/-- Tail bottom
 *             || ||/-- Tail mid
 *             vv vvv
 * origin ->/ "      " \
 *          | "      " |
 *          | " #### " | em
 *          | "#   # " |
 *     rows | "#  ## " |
 *          | " ## # " / <- baseline
 *          | "#  #  "
 *          \ " ##   "
 *             \----/
 *             pitch
 *
 * Leads generally refer to the first non-border non-transparent pixel at that
 * hight, whereas tail refers one past the last such pixel.
 *
 * Each character has up to three forms. The basic form is usually used; the
 * other forms default to the default form if none is present. When one
 * character is overstricken another, the former uses the overstrike form, and
 * the latter uses the reduced form. This is necessary, for example, to form Å»
 * (latin capital Z with dot above), which is represented as a Z with an
 * overstricken '.', requires the '.' to be moved to the top, and the Z to be
 * shortened so that the dot is visible.
 *
 * Overstrike forms of characters are assumed to be centred, and will be
 * centred on top of the underlying character. Since we only care about
 * supporting Polish diacritics, this is sufficient.
 *
 * Ligatures exist for the letter pairs "fl", "ff", "fi", "ft", "AE", "ae",
 * "OE", "oe", and "tz". "Ae" and "Oe" are mapped to "AE" and "OE". Ligatures
 * are mapped to characters in the control character region of ASCII.
 *
 * Font rendering can be affected by escape sequences. Escape sequences begin
 * with BEL ('\a') followed by one character indicating the desired effect, as
 * per the following table. It is always safe to render arbitrary untrusted
 * text.
 *
 *   \a^        The following two characters will be overstricken. Overstrike
 *              character comes first, followed by reduced character.
 *              Example: "je\a^.zy\a^/la"
 *
 *   \aROYGCBM  The colour palette will be rotated from the input palette such
 *              that if the input palette where white, the new palette would be
 *              red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, or magenta,
 *              respectively.
 *
 *   \aW        The colour palette is reset to the input palette.
 *
 * When rendering, pixels are drawn grouped by palette index in descending
 * order, so that more intense pixels are always on top.
 *
 * For most characters, border and lead/tail can be calculated
 * automatically. This is signified by all leads/tails being zero and the
 * manual_border field being false, respeectively. This is generally indicated
 * by omitting these fields from the value definition.
