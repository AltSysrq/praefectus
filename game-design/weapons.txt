(Names below are deliberately fanciful and constructed unusually, in particular
the forced and unnatural calque "barierkarmata".)

0. Kałasznikow
  - White.
  - Fires 10 rounds/sec.
  - Capacity 30. Can pay 1000 points and 2 sec to reload.
  - Rounds move in straight line for one screen before disintegrating.
  - 1 damage/hit.

1. Laser Bógów
  - Green
  - Capacity 5.
  - Hold fire to charge.
  - After firing, requires 1.5 sec to reset.
  - While charging, cannot move reticle.
  - On release, emits instantaneous straight-line beam with a range of 1
    screen. Can hit multiple targets.
  - Damage: charge-time-seconds ^ 2
  - If charged for more than 10 seconds, explodes and auto-kills user.

2. Beryl na Barierkarmatach
  - Cyan
  - Capacity 10.
  - Fires 1 round/sec.
  - Moves in straight line at 1 screen/sec.
  - Upon collision or reaching the location of the reticle at the time of
    firing, explodes, damaging everything within 0.25 screen.
  - Damage: 50 * (1 - distance-in-screens*4)
  - Can collide with Kałasznikow rounds.

3. Bomba Szalona
  - Magenta
  - Capacity 10.
  - Fires 1 round/sec.
  - Initially moves toward the reticle at 0.75 screen/sec
  - Constantly accelerates at 0.5 screen/sec/sec in direction of
    pointing. Initial direction of pointing is 90 degrees clockwise of the
    direction to the reticle. Constantly rotates this direction
    counterclockwise at 1 revolution/sec.
  - Upon collision or reaching the original distance between the point of
    firing and the reticle, relative to the original point of firing, separates
    into 8 spinners and 4 tracers.
  - Spinners begin moving in a random direction at 0.15 screen/sec, and
    accelerate in the same manner as the parent projectile, albeit at 0.1
    screen/sec/sec.
  - Tracers constantly move at 0.5 screen/sec, starting with an random initial
    direction and a zero rotational velocity. Each step, the rotational
    velocity is incremented by a random value between -0.01 rev/sec and +0.01
    rev/sec.
  - Spinners and tracers are given randomly-chosen fully-saturated colours.
  - Both the main projectile and the spinners and tracers can collide with
    Kałasznikow rounds.
  - Spinners disintegrate after 5 seconds; tracers, after 2.
  - Damage: 0 from main projectile; 5 from spinner; 15 from tracer.

4. Gołąb Jeżony
  - Yellow
  - Capacity 25.
  - Fires 2 rounds/sec.
  - The enemy within 2 screens closest to the reticle (if any) is marked as the
    target.
  - Initial direction points directly at the reticle. The direction is
    constantly updated at up to 1 rev/sec to try to point at the target.
  - Constantly moves at 1 screen/sec in the current direction.
  - Disintegrates after 2 seconds.
  - Can collide with Kałasznikow rounds.
  - Damage: 20

5. Zły Tryk
  - Blue
  - Capacity 40.
  - Fires 4 rounds/sec.
  - Moves in the direction of firing at 1.5 screen/sec.
  - Disintegrates after 0.75 sec.
  - On collision, adds 1/4th of its own velocity to that of the victim object.
  - Damage: 2

6. Sprężysta Mrówka
  - Red
  - Capacity 20.
  - Fires 2 rounds/sec.
  - Moves in the direction of firing at 1.25 screen/sec.
  - Disintegrates after 1 sec.
  - On collision, spawns a new projectile in the direction of the nearest
    other enemy. The object that was collided is immune to this projectile. If
    there is no other nearest enemy, spawns in a random direction.
  - Including the original, only up to five projectiles will come into
    existence (ie, the fifth does not spawn).
  - Damage: 5

7. Armata Wesoła
  - Colourless
  - Capacity 5.
  - The fire control *queues* a round for firing.
  - After 1 sec with no new rounds being queued, all queued rounds released
    simultaneously.
  - Release has an angular variance of +/- 15*n degrees, where n is the number
    of queued rounds.
  - 2*n of each weapon type in 1--6 are created. For each instance, an angle
    from the angular variance is chosen, and the reticle is rotated about the
    centre of the player by that amount for the purposes of that instance.
  - Emitted Laser Bógów instances act as if charged for 5 seconds.
  - Damage: none intrinsic.
